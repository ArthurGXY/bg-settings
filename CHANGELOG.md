##  [0.1.0] - 2026-01-01

Happy New Year! And this is the very first release.

This cli command will setup all your monitor (outputs) 
with `swaybg` (if installed) 
and choose a random picture for you from <media-path>
```bash
bg-cli <media-path> setup
```

CLI program source code is at `crate/bg-cli`.

GUI program is not yet available. It will only be so after
the CLI program implements all features I planned in README.md.
